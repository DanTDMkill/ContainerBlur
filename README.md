# ContainerBlur
Allows containers to be blurred in MCP.
# How to Implement
1. Copy the code from GuiContainer.java
2. Paste the code into GuiContainer.java
3. Save & run!
# Disclaimer
It is illegal for me to give out the full code for GuiContainer, so I have used snippets instead. I made sure
that they're easy to understand for beginners, and novices.
# Notes
You may need to change around a couple of things, if you need assistance DM me on Discord (OldBo5#6418).
